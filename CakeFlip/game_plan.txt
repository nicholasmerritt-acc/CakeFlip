generics:
=========
perhaps procedural levels eventually?
start with hand crafted puzzle levels for now

Player competes to skateboard around and pick up baking ingredients
Missing ingredients means you lose score
doing cool tricks can gain score
Missing time limit means you get points deducted / added for speedy etc

“Score x points in y seconds to pass the level”
Missing some points or going slowly means you score less stars. 
Get all 3 stars to feel cool. Get 1 to pass the level

Points for doing tricks
Points for collecting ingredients
Big points for delivering ingredients to the oven and completing a cake while doing a flip


level roadmap:
=========================
Level 1: learning to move
-Drive forward to the finish. ez pz.
Level 2: kickflip / intro to ollie
-Do a trick in the spectator area (but really anywhere, you will score points. But more for doing in front of spectators)
Level 3: learning to cake
-pick up eggs and deliver to oven
-wait for cake
-deliver to finish
Level 4+: ingredients and special tricks
-Combos and recipes become increasingly convoluted
-Etc etc
